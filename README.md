# 🌌 Celestial Quantum Singularity Intelligence

> **"The operating system for post-linear economics."**

## ⚠️ CLASSIFIED: PROPRIETARY ARCHITECTURE
This repository contains the core logic for the **Celestial Quantum** capital allocation engine. Unlike standard algorithmic systems that rely on linear probability (Monte Carlo), this system utilizes **Geometric Vortex Math (3-6-9)** to detect market "Singularities."

### 📐 The Science (New Physics)
* **Implosion vs. Explosion:** Markets do not move in lines; they move in spirals. We identify "Implosion Points" (Vacuums) where capital must flow by physical law.
* **The Singularity Point:** Calculated using the Geometric Mean of the last 9 resonant periods, acting as the "True North" of asset value.

### 🛠️ Capabilities
* **Asymmetric Allocation:** Deploys capital only when mathematical probability exceeds 6-Sigma.
* **Defense-Grade Security:** Codebase is structured for deployment within air-gapped Sovereign Vaults.

### 🔐 Access Protocol
Access to the `src/celestial_core` requires the **Lynchpin Identity Key**.
Unverified execution attempts will result in geometric dissonance (Error 369).
